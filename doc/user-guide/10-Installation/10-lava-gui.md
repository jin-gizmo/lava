## The Lava GUI

Contemporaneous with version 8.1 (Kīlauea), a new version of the desktop lava
GUI has been developed in Flet. The new GUI is a _lot_ better than the original
(which is not high praise, but it really is heaps better). The new GUI is now a
separate project from the lava core.

The new GUI supports macOS and Windows.
