# Jobs and Job Types { x-nav="Jobs & Job Types" }

A lava job is a static definition represented as an entry in the
[jobs](#the-jobs-table) table. Each invocation of a job is
referred to as a *run* which has a unique `run_id`.

The `run_id` is used in construction of prefixes for job outputs in S3 as well
as in event records in the [events](#the-connections-table)
table.

Various job types are supported, depending on the kind of processing required.
Each job type has its own requirements for the `parameters` field in the job
specification.

Jobs can be run in either *normal* mode or in *dev* mode by specifying the
`--dev` argument when invoking the lava worker. In dev mode, the behaviour of
the job may by slightly altered to assist with job development and debugging
without changing the fundamental action of the job. The specifics are job
type dependent.

If the [DEBUG configuration
variable](#general-configuration-parameters) is set to `true`,
some additional information is added to the event records for failed jobs.
