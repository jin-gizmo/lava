## Jinja Rendering FAQ

#### Does lava support recursive rendering?

No.

For any job type that supports Jinja rendering, lava performs only a single
rendering pass. So, for example, it is not possible to include Jinja syntax in
a `vars` variable that references an element in `globals` as this would require
two rendering passes to first inject the global into the var and then render the
Jinja content of the var.
