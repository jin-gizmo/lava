## Connectors FAQ

This section covers questions related to connectors in general as well as those
specific to particular job types.

### General Questions

#### Why is psycopg2 not supported?

In a word, licensing. Psycopg2 is LGPL.

#### Why is pygresql not supported?

As of v5.0.0 (Cotopaxi), [pygresql](https://www.pygresql.org/) can be specified
as the driver to use for Postgres family connectors using the `subtype` field in
the connection specification.

It is strongly recommended to stick with the default of
[pg8000](https://github.com/tlocke/pg8000) for the
[db_from_s3](#job-type-db_from_s3) and
[redshift_unload](#job-type-redshift_unload) job types.

#### Why would I use pygresql instead of pg8000?

Insert performance of [pg8000](https://github.com/tlocke/pg8000) is poor.
For Python based jobs inserting a lot of data,
[pygresql](https://www.pygresql.org/) should give better performance.

#### Is SQLAlchemy supported?

As of v5.0.0 (Cotopaxi), the SQL based connectors provide native support for
[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/). An SQLAlchemy engine can be created
using a lava connector to manage the underlying connection process.
