## Lava S3 Locations

Each lava realm has two designated S3 locations:

1.  The payload area that contains the artefacts required to run a job (scripts
    etc.).  This location is specified by the `s3_payloads` field in the [realms
    table](#the-realms-table).

2.  The temporary area that contains outputs produced during the run of the job.
    This location is specified by the `s3_temp` field in the [realms
    table](#the-realms-table). This area can be used to transfer
    artefacts from one job to another. It would normally have an S3 lifecycle
    rule to remove objects after a short period of time (e.g. 1 or 2 days).

A bucket for each realm is created by the [CloudFormation
templates](#lava-installation-and-operation).
