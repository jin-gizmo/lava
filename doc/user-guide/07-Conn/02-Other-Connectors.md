## Other Connectors

Lava also provides connectors for various other types of resource, including
sFTP servers, SharePoint sites, SMB fileshares and the AWS CLI. These are
typically used either by a job type that is specific to the target resource or
in [exe](#job-type-exe), [pkg](#job-type-pkg)
and [docker](#job-type-docker)
jobs.
